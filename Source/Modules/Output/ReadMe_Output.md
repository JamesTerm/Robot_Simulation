# Output Group

- Simulated Output
- WPI Output
- Output properties

The simulated output can make use of SLAM data and present it in a way that can help see how the output will behave.  Typically in the past this has been used to monitor the drive from a top view 2D analyses of motion, but could indeed by translated to a 3D representation.  It can alternative pull data from the Robot to show some representation of this data.  The SmartDashboard could be considered a simulated output.

Finally the WPI Output can pull data from the robot to update components as well as give data from sensors back to the robot, where the properties can help map out the slot assignments for each component.
