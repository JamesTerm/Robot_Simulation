The *Robot* will pull input and push output.  This is where the drive kinematics resides, it will use properties and if done correct should be able to survive multiple seasons.  The most common component of the robot is the rotary system, and so this is the front end for what is to be the output.

*SLAM* (Simultaneous localization and mapping) is the object that keeps track of it's position on the field.  It will bind to robot to get sensor information (localization) to determine where it really is.  The mapping aspect can be addressed per game as needed.
